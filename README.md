# Data Jobs And Salaries

## Overview

This project analyzes how salaries in the data industry are influenced by various factors such as company size, location, job category, and experience level. The goal is to understand key determinants of salary levels and identify trends to inform job seekers and industry professionals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [Jobs and Salaries in Data Field 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murilozangari/jobs-and-salaries-in-data-field-2024/data). The original data comes from [AI-Jobs.net](https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/2024/).

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis was conducted using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Seaborn for statistical graphics.

## Conclusions

- **Salary Influencers**: Job salary is related to experience level, job title/category, employment type, work setting, company size, location, and employee residence.
- **High Salary Factors**:
  - Executive experience level
  - Full-time contracts
  - In-person work settings
  - Medium to large-sized companies
- **Top-Paying Job Category**: "Machine Learning and AI" pays the most.

## Model Training Results

No model outperformed the dummy model that used the simple mean of the observations. This suggests that either the models did not effectively capture the underlying patterns in the data, or the data itself may not contain significant patterns that more complex models could exploit.
